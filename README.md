Using the Library

Initiate Account Transaction
Instantiate a client and set the parameters. Then perform service authentication by instantiating the authentication service object and passing the client to it in its constructor. Retrieve your token by calling the getToken() method.
        
private readonly IAuthentication _IAuthentication;
private readonly IStandardCheckOut _IStandardCheckOut;

    public ClassConstructor(IAuthentication iAuthentication, IStandardCheckOut iStandardCheckOut)
    {
         _IAuthentication = iAuthentication;
         this._IStandardCheckOut = iStandardCheckOut;
    }

    public async Task<string> TestMethod()
    {
     var token = await _IAuthentication.Token(privateKey, publicKey);

//After retrieving your token following authentication proceed to pass it to the StandardCheckOut constructor along with your client object. You can then construct your payload and call the Payment() method of the StandardCheckOut class.

     var request = new StandardCheckPaymentRequest
                {
                    amount = "",
                    callbackUrl = "",
                    country = "",
                    currency = "",
                    email = "",
                    hashType = "",
                    paymentReference = "",
                    productDescription = "",
                    productId = "",
                    publicKey = ""
                };
     
     var result = await this._IStandardCheckOut.Payment(request, token);
     return result;
   }
